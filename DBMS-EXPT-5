Hereâ€™s a structured SQL Practical Assignment for you:

SQL Practical Assignment
Title: Applying Aggregate Functions (COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX, SUM) in SQL
Objective:
To understand and apply aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, and AVG in SQL to analyze student data.

Task 1: Create the Student Table
Write an SQL query to create a table named Student with the following attributes:

Column Name	Data Type	Description
ID	INT (Primary Key)	Unique Student ID
Name	VARCHAR(100)	Studentâ€™s Name
Age	INT	Studentâ€™s Age
Branch	VARCHAR(50)	Studentâ€™s Branch
Fees_Paid	DECIMAL(10,2)	Fees Paid by the Student
SQL Query to Create Table:
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE Student (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Age INT,
    Branch VARCHAR(50),
    Fees_Paid DECIMAL(10,2)
);
Task 2: Insert Sample Data
Insert at least 5 records into the Student table for testing.

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO Student (ID, Name, Age, Branch, Fees_Paid) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 20, 'CSBS', 50000.00),
(2, 'Bob', 21, 'IT', 45000.00),
(3, 'Charlie', 22, 'CSBS', 48000.00),
(4, 'David', 23, 'ECE', 52000.00),
(5, 'Emma', 20, 'CSBS', 53000.00);
Task 3: Apply Aggregate Functions
Find the total number of students.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Students FROM Student;
Find the number of students admitted in the CSBS branch.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT COUNT(*) AS CSBS_Students FROM Student WHERE Branch = 'CSBS';
Find the total fees paid by all students.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT SUM(Fees_Paid) AS Total_Fees_Paid FROM Student;
Find the minimum and maximum fees paid by students.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT MIN(Fees_Paid) AS Min_Fees, MAX(Fees_Paid) AS Max_Fees FROM Student;
Find the average fees paid by students.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT AVG(Fees_Paid) AS Average_Fees FROM Student;
Task 4: Observe and Analyze
Execute the above queries and note down the output.

Observe how aggregate functions help in summarizing data.

Try adding more student records and re-run the queries to see the updated results.

Conclusion:
This practical exercise helps in understanding how aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG) can be used to analyze and summarize database records.

Would you like me to format this for submission (e.g., add a cover page)? ðŸ˜Š
